# Notes App

Users can create new notes with text features like bold, italicize and underline.

Each note is saved in local storage and can be accessed after the page has been refreshed or closed.

Notes are bumped to the top of the sidebar as they are modified.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
